## Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) spreads widely around the whole world since the end of 2019 (Huang et al., 2020). Many measures have been implemented to curb it, but there are still around 4,550,837 new cases per week in April 2021. According to the Weekly epidemiological update on COVID-19 of the World Health Organization¬—WHO (2021), there have 135,057,587 confirmed cases and 2,919,932 deaths by 13 April 2021. Though many detection and diagnosis methods of COVID-19 has been developed (Bai et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), the most effective way to control the epidemic disease nowadays is to wear masks in public, since it can prevent small respiratory droplets from transmitting the virus among people (Howard et al., 2021). Cheng et al. (2020) also verified the contribution of masks in this situation. Most governments around the world encourage and even published temporary legislation to demand citizens to wear face masks in public (Congressional Documents and Publications, 2020). But there are still many people who do not willing or forget to wear face masks when they come into public places. Our project aims to automatically identify whether faces detected are with or without masks. It could be applied in some public places and signal the guards when finding someone who does not abide by the regulations. In this case, guards do not need to patrol around or staring surveillance cameras all the time. A lot of work for guards can be saved and the effectiveness is also improved. 

## Research Question
How to use the webcam to detect whether people wear masks properly and what measures can be taken to improve the accuracy of the face mask detection model which is originally base on the simple [Cats vs Dogs] https://github.com/djdunc/casa0018/blob/main/Week2/CASA0018_2_3_Cats_v_Dogs.ipynb?
*probably 1 or 2 sentences*

## Application Overview
Thinking back to the various application diagrams you have seen through the module - how would you describe an overview of the building blocks of your project - how do they connect, what do the component parts include.

*probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to convey your design!*

## Data
Describe what data sources you have used and any cleaning, wrangling or organising you have done. Including some examples of the data helps others understand what you have been working with.

*probably ~200 words and images of what the data 'looks like' are good!*

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?

*probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!*

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results? 

*probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!*

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?  

*probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!*
